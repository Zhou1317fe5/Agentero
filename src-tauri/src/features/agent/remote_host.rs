//! Dependency inversion for remote-vault BYOA.
//!
//! The agent feature must not import `integration::remote` (features may only
//! depend on core). The remote side (`integration::remote::launch`) implements
//! these traits for `RemoteSession` / `RemoteRegistry`, and the desktop app
//! registers `Arc<dyn RemoteAgentHosts>` as Tauri state; commands consume it
//! via `State<'_, Arc<dyn RemoteAgentHosts>>`.
