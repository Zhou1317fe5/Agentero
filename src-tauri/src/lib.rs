//! Agentero Host library (`agentero_lib`).
//!
//! - [`run`] — Tauri app entry (desktop / mobile).
//! - [`core`] / [`features`] — bridge the tauri-free `agentero-core` crate
//!   (which the headless CLI consumes directly) and keep the desktop shells
//!   (`#[tauri::command]` surfaces, JobCenter, watcher, integrations).
//!
//! Assembly lives in [`app`]; domain logic in [`features`].

/// desktop-only shells. `features::agent` (BYOA) is desktop-only.

/// External integrations (bridge, MCP, remote vault, cloud sync).
/// Desktop-only; CLI must not depend on these.
