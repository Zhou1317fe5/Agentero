//! Host abstraction for the tauri-free domain services.
//!
//! Desktop wraps its `tauri::AppHandle` into [`AppHandle`] with a [`HostHooks`]
//! implementation (see `agentero_lib::core::app_handle`), letting the shared
//! business logic emit frontend events and schedule follow-up jobs without
//! knowing about Tauri. Headless consumers (CLI) pass `None` — every hook is
//! then a no-op, matching the historical headless semantics where the desktop
//! branches were compiled out.
