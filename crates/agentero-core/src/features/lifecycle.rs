//! Semantic lifecycle events emitted at key backend milestones (tauri-free).
//!
//! The desktop job events (`job:completed` / `job:failed`) stay in the Host
//! crate (`agentero_lib::features::lifecycle`) because they depend on the
//! JobCenter; the paper fact events live here and reach the frontend through
//! the [`crate::app_handle::HostHooks`] emit callback.
